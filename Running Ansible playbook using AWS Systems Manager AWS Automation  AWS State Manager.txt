Running Ansible playbook using AWS Systems Manager


Pre-Requisities
IAM Role - i.e ManagedInstanceRole - with managed permissions Get Help for setting up IAM Role
AmazonEC2RoleforSSM - To allow Lambda to log events
Prepare Target Instances
Lets use a RedHat 7.x Linux instances as our target instance.

Assign the IAM Role created in the prerequisite
Install SSM Agent
sudo yum install -y https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm
sudo systemctl enable amazon-ssm-agent
sudo systemctl start amazon-ssm-agent
sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent

Install Ansible in Redhat 7
sudo rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
sudo yum -y install ansible

Tag the instance
TagKey:OS
TagValue:RedHat

Create SSM State Manager
Choose State Manager from the System Manager Services
Click on Create Association
Name = install-HTTP-On-RedHat
Document name prefix: Equal : AWS-RunAnsiblePlaybook
Select the AWS-RunAnsiblePlaybook
For Targets Choose Specifying tags
Choose appropriate schedule.
In the Parameters Section, paste the playbook YAML directly.
Define the max errors as 1. This means that if the execution encounters 1 error it will stop on the remaining targets.
Testing the solution
Create an adhoc run using the Run Command manually, check the S3 Logs for execution results.

ToDo
Load the playbook into CodeCommit and bring it under version control.
or Use S3 version control for the playbook(s) to be stored.

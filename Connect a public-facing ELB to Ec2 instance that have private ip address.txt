Connect a public-facing ELB to Ec2 instance that have private ip address

1) Create a VPC with 1 public and 1 private subnet
2) Keep the both public and private subnets in the same AZ
3) Assign the nat Gateway Elastic ip address and create a VPC 
4) Create a ELB (classic Load balancer) and select the VPC
5) Keep the load balancer in the public subnet and remove the private subnet 
6) Create a new security group with port no 80 enabled
7) create a ELB without any instance added
8) Create 2 Ec2 instances (Amilinux) and Keep the 2 instance in the private subnet and disable the auto assign public ip option
9) Attach the below userdata script
#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
chkconfig httpd on
echo $HOSTNAME> /var/www/html/index.html
chown apache /var/www/html/index.html
/etc/init.d/httpd start

10) Attach the instance with the default security groups
11) Launch the 2 private instances and click ELB and add the instances 
12) Click on the actions button click edit security groups and select the both security groups(default and also SG which is created for the ELB) 
13) Instance will pass the health test after 5 minutes

Conclusion:

we can have 2 apache web servers running on ec2 instances which are not exposes to web behind the public ELB

automate the creation of AMIs based on my EBS-backed EC2 instance using Systems Manager Automation

You can use AWS Systems Manager to create a maintenance window, and then register an automation task to automate the creation of the AMIs. This process is applicable for both Windows and Linux instances.

The instance that you want to create an AMI for must be listed as a managed instance in Systems Manager. First, verify that the instance meets all prerequisites for using Systems Manager. If the instance uses a private subnet, you can create VPC endpoints for Systems Manager.

Note (Windows only): Sysprep isn't run on Windows instances before creating an AMI when you use the following automation process.
Resolution
To automate the creation of AMIs, follow these steps:

Create Ec2 instances and attach the system manager full permissions

1) Goto IAM console ---> Roles ---> Select Ec2 ---> select AmazonSSMMaintenenceWindowsRole and create role
2) Choose add inline policy ---> select service ---> select Ec2 ---> select the Write Access level ---> choose Createimage and under the Read Access level ---> select choose DescribeImage
3) Go to the trust relationships

    }
  ]
}
4) Go to systems manager and select maintainance windows option --> Create Maintainance window ---> Give the name ---> select Cron scheduled Builder (Every Tuesday 12:00hrs)---> Specify the duration 2 hrs and 1hr stop initiating tasks ---> create
5) Select the maintainance window ---> select Action ---> Register Targets 
6) Give name and description ---> Targets (select the instances) ---> Register Target 
7) Go back to the maintanance window ---> Actions ---> Register Automation Tasks
8) Enter name and description ---> Select the document (AWS Create Image) ---> select the register target group ---> select the target which is created
9) Rate control (concurrency 1 targets) and (error threshold 1 errors)
10) Select the IAM Role created
11) In Input parameters (instanceID = {{TARGET_ID}} ---> Register Automation Tasks

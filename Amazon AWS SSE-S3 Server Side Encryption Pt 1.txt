Amazon AWS SSE-S3 Server Side Encryption Pt 1

AWS provides various options to encrypt your data on S3.

 

There are 2 types of encryption:

 

Client side: Client encrypts locally using tool/software of their choices

Server Side encryption: Choose from available choices in AWS

In this video, our focus will be Server Side Encryption (SSE) since Client side is open to your preference/choices/requirement.

 

Server Side has 3 types of encryption as well:

 

SSE-S3: One click encryption

SSE-KMS: Using KMS

SSE-C: Not available in console. Customer provides the keys

 

Encrypt a file using SSE S3:

 

$ aws s3 cp abcd.txt s3://kms-test11 –sse

 

To  create a  kms key:

$ aws kms create-key -description “my kms key”

 

List all the keys:

$aws kms aws kms list-keys

 

This will not help us identify the correct key. Create an Alias for the key we created:

aws kms create-alias –alias-name alias/example-alias –target-key-id 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

 

 

Then let’s list the alias of the keys as well.

$ aws kms list-aliases

 

To upload and encrypt a file to S3 bucket using your KMS key:

 

aws s3 cp file.txt s3://kms-test11 –sse aws:kms –sse-kms-key-id 4dabac80-8a9b-4ada-b3af-fc0faaaac5

 

Upload and encrypt a file using default KMS Key for S3 in the region:

 

aws s3 cp file.txt s3://kms-test11 –sse aws:kms


Using EC2Rescue for Windows Server with Systems Manager Run Command
AWS Support provides you with a Systems Manager Run Command document to interface with your Systems Manager-enabled instance to run EC2Rescue for Windows Server. The Run Command document is called AWSSupport-RunEC2RescueForWindowsTool.

This Systems Manager Run Command document performs the following tasks:

Downloads and verifies EC2Rescue for Windows Server.

Imports a PowerShell module to ease your interaction with the tool.

Runs EC2RescueCmd with the provided command and parameters.

The Systems Manager Run Command document accepts three parameters:

Command—The EC2Rescue for Windows Server action. The current allowed values are:

ResetAccess—Resets the local Administrator password. The local Administrator password of the current instance will be reset and the randomly generated password will be securely stored in Parameter Store as /EC2Rescue/Password/<INSTANCE_ID>. If you select this action and provide no parameters, passwords are encrypted automatically with the default KMS key. Optionally, you can specify a KMS Key ID in Parameters to encrypt the password with your own key.

CollectLogs—Runs EC2Rescue for Windows Server with the /collect:all action. If you select this action, Parameters must include an Amazon S3 bucket name to upload the logs to.

FixAll—Runs EC2Rescue for Windows Server with the /rescue:all action. If you select this action, Parameters must include the block device name to rescue.

Parameters—The PowerShell parameters to pass for the specified command.

Note

In order for the ResetAccess action to work, your Amazon EC2 instance needs to have the following policy attached in order to write the encrypted password to Parameter Store. Please wait a few minutes before attempting to reset the password of an instance after you have attached this policy to the related IAM role.

Using the default KMS key:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:PutParameter"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ssm:region:account_id:parameter/EC2Rescue/Passwords/<instanceid>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}


Using a custom KMS key:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ssm:PutParameter"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ssm:region:account_id:parameter/EC2Rescue/Passwords/<instanceid>"
        ] 
      }, 
      { 
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
      "kms:Encrypt"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:kms:region:account_id:key/<kmskeyid>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

monitor automatic recovery of my EC2 instances using CloudWatch alarms and SNS

Create a CloudWatch alarm for your EC2 instances. For more information, see How can I set up a CloudWatch alarm to automatically recover my EC2 instance?

For Send notification to, enter your SNS topic name.
For Take the action, choose Recover.
Configure CloudWatch Events to monitor the following AWS Health events. For Target, choose the SNS topic you created.

AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_AUTO_RECOVERY_SUCCESS
AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_AUTO_RECOVERY_NO_ACTION
AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_AUTO_RECOVERY_FAILURE

You can also use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to list the AWS Health events associated with EC2 instance automatic recovery. Use the command describe-event-types with the appropriate --region as follows:
$ aws health describe-event-types --filter services=EC2 --query eventTypes[].code --region us-east-1 | grep AUTO_RECOVERY
"AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_AUTO_RECOVERY_FAILURE",
"AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_AUTO_RECOVERY_NO_ACTION",
"AWS_EC2_INSTANCE_AUTO_RECOVERY_SUCCESS",
Automatic recovery results are then emailed to both your AWS account's main contact and alternate contact. Look for email subject lines similar to:

[Auto Recovery] Amazon EC2 instance recovery: Success
[Auto Recovery] Amazon EC2 instance recovery: No action taken
[Auto Recovery] Amazon EC2 instance recovery: Failure
